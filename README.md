# Expectation maximization
Hosted here is Nathaniel's expectation maximization software that a few projects are currently using. 

This implements an expectation maximization algorithm (originally based on Quentin Huys' work, Huys et al. PLoS CB 2012) for fitting RL models hierarchically, with a group level distribution and per-subject parameters. See example.jl or example.ipynb for details.

# Requirements
* Julia version 1.5+
* packages listed in example.jl
